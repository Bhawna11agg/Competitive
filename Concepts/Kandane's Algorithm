use to maximum sum of subarray.

According to this algo we have to make two variables and we have to take some of every element if that variable becomes negative
then make it zero and start calculating sum from there and in that store maximum sum coming in between traversal.


int maxSubArraySum(int a[], int size) 
{ 
    int max_so_far = INT_MIN, max_ending_here = 0; 
  
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) 
    { 
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]; 
        if (max_so_far < max_ending_here) 
            max_so_far = max_ending_here; 
  
        if (max_ending_here < 0) 
            max_ending_here = 0; 
    } 
    return max_so_far; 
}
